#*MY HOBBIES*

Myself Bhagwant Singh, Today I am to talk about my hobbies. As I got no time during weekdays.
so, all the things I do on weekends are my hobbies.

I love to
* listen old punjabi songs
* sunbath
* Read newspaper
* Sleep for long hours

Other than that,I love to travel at hilly areas and to enjoy the beauty of nature. I am very fond
of travelling, exploring new places and talking to people of that area. Whereever I go, I always bring
a souvenir of that city.

Some of my travelling pictures.

All these things provide me a new energy to again work for the next days.
Thanks.
